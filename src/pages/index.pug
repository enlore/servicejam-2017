      p.
        In more than 100 cities around the world each year, design thinking
        enthusiasts join forces on a weekend in February for the Global Service Jam‘s
        weekend of service design to change the world. They are designers, artists,
        business people, mothers, community members, students, legislators and
        citizens. They meet with one goal in mind: to create, prototype, and publish a
        new service in less than 48 hours.
      p.
        For many, Service Jam is their first contact with Service Design. To get
        everyone on equal footing and immersed, we are adding a Service Design Intro on
        Thursday 16th of February. The Intro is a 2-hour introduction to the methods
        used during the Jam. Even if this is your first venture into Service Design,
        Kickstart will give you the knowledge to make the most out of the Jam. If
        you're already a veteran, feel free to join in on Thursday. There's always
        something new to learn.

      h4.q What is Service Design?
      p.
        Service design is the activity of planning and organizing people,
        infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in
        order to improve its quality and the interaction between service provider
        and customers. The purpose of service design methodologies is to design
        according to the needs of customers or participants, so that the service
        is user-friendly, competitive and relevant to the customers. 

      h4.q What is a Service?
      p.
        We experience services every day — buying insurance, taking a flight,
        filing a tax return, receiving a heart transplant. A service is an
        exchange of goods or value. A complete service includes designed or
        planned interactions among people, products, and processes in various
        places and over time. We often encounter a service (like visiting the DMV
        or a hair salon) where only some parts of its service touchpoints are
        designed with clear intention and purpose. In fact, most services we have
        today kind of just “happen” and aren’t consciously designed even though
        about 80% of our economy is services!
