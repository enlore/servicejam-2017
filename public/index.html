        <h2>Feb 17th - 19th, 2017</h2>
        <p>
          In more than 100 cities around the world each year, design thinking
          enthusiasts join forces on a weekend in February for the Global Service Jam‘s
          weekend of service design to change the world. They are designers, artists,
          business people, mothers, community members, students, legislators and
          citizens. They meet with one goal in mind: to create, prototype, and publish a
          new service in less than 48 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many, Service Jam is their first contact with Service Design. To get
          everyone on equal footing and immersed, we are adding a Service Design Intro on
          Thursday 16th of February. The Intro is a 2-hour introduction to the methods
          used during the Jam. Even if this is your first venture into Service Design,
          Kickstart will give you the knowledge to make the most out of the Jam. If
          you're already a veteran, feel free to join in on Thursday. There's always
          something new to learn.

        <h4 class="q">What is Service Design?</h4>
        <p>
          Service design is the activity of planning and organizing people,
          infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in
          order to improve its quality and the interaction between service provider
          and customers. The purpose of service design methodologies is to design
          according to the needs of customers or participants, so that the service
          is user-friendly, competitive and relevant to the customers. 
          
        </p>
        <h4 class="q">What is a Service?</h4>
        <p>
          We experience services every day — buying insurance, taking a flight,
          filing a tax return, receiving a heart transplant. A service is an
          exchange of goods or value. A complete service includes designed or
          planned interactions among people, products, and processes in various
          places and over time. We often encounter a service (like visiting the DMV
          or a hair salon) where only some parts of its service touchpoints are
          designed with clear intention and purpose. In fact, most services we have
          today kind of just “happen” and aren’t consciously designed even though
          about 80% of our economy is services!
